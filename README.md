# docx2tabs

Tired of copy-pasting strings of text from a word file to a spreadsheet? The "Hack and Yack docx2tabs tutorial" will show you what a .docx file looks like behind the scenes and teach you how to use word styles to annotate it in order to feed it into a jupyter notebook that will transform it in tabular data (.csv / spreadsheet).

The tutorial is divided into two parts.
First:
- we will look at the hidden structure of docx files
- learn how to create styles and annotate a docx file
- understand the differences between paragraph and character styles
Secondly:
- we will use a jupyter notebook (hosted on Google Colab) to produce a preliminary transformation of the docx file into a csv.

A dataset/docx to experiement with will be provided to the attendees at the beginning of the training. 
If time allows, and you'd like to bring your own document we can try to process it together.

Requirements:
- google account to access Colab
- knowledge of Word Office

Useful but not neceessary:
- understanding of XML and jupyter notebooks

Even more useful:
- knowledge of XPATH and Python

The training will not teach how to write a python notebook to process your data, but it will explain how to use the existing one to transform data.
If you have any specific project in mind or legacy document that you would like to transform, Giorgia will be available for further discussions after the training.
